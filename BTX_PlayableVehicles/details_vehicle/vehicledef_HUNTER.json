  "Description": {
    "Details": "Its low profile and twenty-tube FarFire Maxi-Rack LRM-20 allows the tank to exploit sheltering terrain and supply indirect fire support. While the close range rearward facing Zippo Flamer provides close anti-infantry work in case of emergencies, it is more commonly used to provide a burning smoke cover for retreating units. With 2 tons of ammunition it can provide long-range fire support for a prolonged period of time. The Flamer is hardly ever used in direct combat.",
