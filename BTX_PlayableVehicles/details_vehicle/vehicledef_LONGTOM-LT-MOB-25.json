    "Details": "The purpose of this entire convoy of vehicles was to move one weapon: an Armstrong Industries Long Tom Rifle Mobile Chassis System. The artillery piece was capable of extremely long range fire more suited to demolishing defensive fortifications than firing into a firefight. The only short-range weapons were four, side-mounted SperryBrowning Machine Guns that were more suited to anti-infantry than anti-'Mech duty.",
