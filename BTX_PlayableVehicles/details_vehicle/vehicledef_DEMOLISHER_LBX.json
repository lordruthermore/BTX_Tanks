  "Description": {
    "Details": "The Demolisher is armed with two 185 mm ChemJet Gun AC/20s, which are enough to make any other unit, 'Mechs included, pause. The relatively short range of the guns means that maneuverable units with long-range weaponry can confound the Demolisher. It utilizes 10 tons of armor for protection, and the I.C.E. motor allows for a cruising speed 32.4kph. The tank also lacks any form of secondary weapons, which may be detrimental when the massive cannons run dry.",
