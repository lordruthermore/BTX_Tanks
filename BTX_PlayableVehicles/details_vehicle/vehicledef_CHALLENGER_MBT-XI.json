  "Description": {
    "Details": "The Challenger's primary weaponry includes a turret mounted Poland Main Model A Gauss Rifle with two tons of ammo, giving the tank a needed long range punch as well as one-shot-one-kill capability. To help combat battle armor and other threats, an Imperator Code Red LB 10-X Autocannon is also turret-mounted with two tons of ammo, allowing the tank to carry both solid and cluster rounds to respond to any situation it might face. An Artemis IV FCS-enhanced Federated 10-Shot Long Range Missile Launcher with two tons of ammunition joins the main guns in the turret to supplement their long range firepower. To combat threats at short range, the Challenger X has also been equipped with a potent point-defense consisting of a pair of Federated Super Streak SRM 2 launchers protecting the sides of the tank, two front-mounted Martell Medium Pulse Lasers and a rear-mounted Exostar Small Pulse Laser defending the tank's stern flank.",
