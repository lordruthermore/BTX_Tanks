    "Details": "The armament on a MASH Truck is not intended to fight off an attacking 'Mech, but rather discourage theft. Due to their value, mercenary units will sometimes try to capture a MASH before or after battle, when they are not treating patients, by blockading them or killing the driver, hence the armament, but no unit will risk destroying a MASH. However, many doctors feel that arming a MASH Truck violates their Hippocratic Oath, and have the weapons removed.",
