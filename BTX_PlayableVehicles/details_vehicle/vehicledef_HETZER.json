    "Details": "Drawing all firepower from a massive Autocannon/20, the Hetzer can easily blast through thick armor, whether it's mounted on a BattleMech or vehicle. Also, the tank carries four tons of ammunition, enabling it to obliterate a number of enemies before being forced to reload. Its downsides include its limited firing-arc, its complete dependence on a short-range weapon, a lack of back-up weaponry, and mediocre speed.",
