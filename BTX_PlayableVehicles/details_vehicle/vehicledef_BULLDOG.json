    "Details": "The Large Laser is the tank's main gun. It has decent range and striking power, but critics note that mounting such a large energy weapon on an ICE-powered vehicle is a waste of tonnage. Two SRM-4-racks, supplied with two tons of ammunition, are reliable back-ups and the Hovertech Quad is well-known throughout the Inner Sphere. The Machine Gun mounted in the vehicle's front was developed by Bulldog Enterprises as well and is operated by the driver.",
