    "Details": "APCs are not fighting vehicles, for their main function is to transport infantry squads from one battle to another. The Sleipnir APC carries two Machine Guns and two Medium Lasers in a turret, but these are carried usually only for defense against other infantry units. The machine guns have a half ton of ammunition available. The main feature of the Sleipnir is the four ton infantry bay located in the body. It is protected by seven tons of armor.",
