    "Details": "A pair of SureShot Mk VI SRM 6-racks give the Harasser more firepower than any other vehicle in its class, but this does come with a price, as it only mounts one and half tons of armor. With such little armor, its best defensive strategy is to use its speed. With a maximum speed of 162 kph, a fleeing Harasser can outrun nearly everything, running circles around heavier BattleMechs and making it a much harder target to hit.",
