  "Description": {
    "Details": "Primarily a stand-off fighter, the Ares carries a Series 7Ja ER Large Laser in its turret. Mounted in the front are Type X "Short Bow" LRM-10 and Type XV "Crossbow" LRM-15 launchers, each of which include an Artemis IV Fire Control System. In addition, the missiles can be fired indirectly with the help of a spotter; though somewhat un-Clanlike, indirect fire can preserve the safety of an Ares and its crew. On the other hand, the Clantech missiles have no problem arming quickly, making them just as potent up close, unlike their Inner Sphere counterparts; this makes the Ares that much deadlier at short range. However, the limited ammunition supply forces gunners to rely primarily on the laser, using the missiles sparingly.",
