    "Details": "This 3011 variant keeps the standard Brutus armor layout and Large Lasers, but replaces the LRM and SRM-6 launchers with a single PPC. For additional short range firepower four SRM-2 racks are mounted on the vehicle but one ton of ammunition can lead to shortages in an ongoing battle.",
