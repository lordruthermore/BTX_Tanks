  "Description": {
    "Details": "While its chassis is identical to its LRM counterpart, the SRM Carrier mounts ten forward-firing SRM-6 launchers. Quikscell utilizes Holly brand launchers, but carriers produced by other manufacturers frequently use the launchers common to their House of origin, such as HoverTech SRMs in the Federated Suns or NCK in the Draconis Combine. While the SRM carrier must physically move to change firing angles a barrage fired from a missile carrier is a fearsome sight, and four tons of ammunition allow a carrier to keep up that rate of fire up for over a minute, but forces carriers to be tied to a functioning supply system to keep them in action for any extended period.",
