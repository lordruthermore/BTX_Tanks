    "Details": "The tank's main weapon is the Parti-Kill Heavy Cannon PPC, backed up by a SureShot Mk VI SRM-6 rack. The LRM is mounted on top of the main turret, just above and behind the particle cannon. It is mounted on vertical and horizontal swivel mounts, giving the pack a full 120-degree arc of fire independent of the turret. Both PPC and SRM are supported in their respective range brackets by a Far Fire Medium Missile Rack and OMI High Burn Medium Laser.",
