    "Details": "The Turhan's principal weaponry was its twin Amdecker 300 Large Lasers which were mounted in its turret. Mounted with the lasers were a pair of Ramsey-65 Machine Guns. The vehicle had a five-ton Infantry Compartment, which allowed for troops and some supplies to be transported into conflict zones. The vehicle is protected by seven and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor, which ensured its cargo arrived at the designation intact.",
