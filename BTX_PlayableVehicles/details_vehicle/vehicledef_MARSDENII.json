    "Details": "The tank's main gun, the turret-mounted Arcturan Arms Longarm Series Autocannon/5, serves as its principle long range weapon, with one ton of ammunition for it. Providing for close-in firepower, the tank has two front-mounted, 6-tube Short Range Missile launchers with two tons of ammunition. To handle infantry, the Marsden II mounts a pair of General A70 Model Machine Guns, which share half a ton of ammunition. The tank is protected by 17.5 tons of 'Mech grade armor, with more protection allocated to its front. The tank's internal combustion engine provides enough horsepower to give tank a good 54 km/h. This allowed it to keep respectable speed when facing frontline forces.",
