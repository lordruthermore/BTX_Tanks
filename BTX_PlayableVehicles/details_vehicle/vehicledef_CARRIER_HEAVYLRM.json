  "Description": {
    "Details": "The simple, yet brutally effective, armament of the Carrier is four Delta Dart LRM-20 Launchers. These enable the Heavy LRM Carrier to stand off and blitz opponents with round after round of missiles. These are compatible with special munitions, allowing the vehicle to be effective in a variety of situations with proper preparation. The design excels when using its weapons indirectly as it can fire its massive armament without risk of taking enemy fire. The inclusion of all four launchers in a turret enable the Carrier's crew to fire at all enemies within range, no matter where they are on the battlefield.",
