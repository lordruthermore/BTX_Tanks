  "Description": {
    "Details": "The Drillson relies mostly on the Cyclops Eye Large Laser based in its turret. This weapon and its associated fire control system were developed specifically for this vehicle by the ordnance division of Cyclops, Inc. This unconventional design uses a combination of laser energy and particle-beam technology. The unique structure of this system enables it to dispense with the relatively vulnerable reflector systems. Mounted alongside the Cyclops Eye are two HoverTech SRM-2-racks supplied with one ton of ammunition. A single Light CrossBow LRM-10 and two Kicker Machine Guns complete the weapons array.",
