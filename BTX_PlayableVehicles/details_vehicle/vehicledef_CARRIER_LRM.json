  "Description": {
    "Details": "While its chassis is identical to its SRM counterpart, the LRM Carrier mounts three forward-firing LRM-20. Quikscell utilize FarFire brand launchers, but carriers produced by other manufacturers frequently use the launchers common to their House of origin, such as DeltaDart LRMs in the Federated Suns or Shigunga in the Draconis Combine. A barrage fired from a missile carrier is a fearsome sight and four tons of ammunition allow a carrier to keep up that rate of fire up for over a minute, but the carrier must physically move to change firing angles and the high rate of ammunition consumption forces carriers to be tied to a functioning supply system to keep them in action for any extended period.",
