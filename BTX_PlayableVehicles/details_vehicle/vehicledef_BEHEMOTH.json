    "Details": "The two turret-mounted SarLon MaxiCannon AC-10s enable the Behemoth to deal out a great deal of damage at a long distance. The four front-mounted LongFire Light Missile Racks increase this damage potential, particularly in the forward arc of fire. For closer targets, two Harvester 20K SRM-6 packs are mounted on the turret and the Behemoth boasts two ball turrets, each mounting one Harvester 2K SRM-2 and two MainFire MiniGuns. The final two Harvester 2K SRM-2 packs are mounted in a half-turret on the front of tank.",
